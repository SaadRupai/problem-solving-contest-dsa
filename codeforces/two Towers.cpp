// There are two towers consisting of blocks of two colors: red and blue. Both towers are represented by strings of characters B and/or R denoting the order of blocks in them from the bottom to the top, where B corresponds to a blue block, and R corresponds to a red block.
// These two towers are represented by strings BRBB and RBR.

// You can perform the following operation any number of times: choose a tower with at least two blocks, and move its top block to the top of the other tower.

// The pair of towers is beautiful if no pair of touching blocks has the same color; i.â€‰e. no red block stands on top of another red block, and no blue block stands on top of another blue block.

// You have to check if it is possible to perform any number of operations (possibly zero) to make the pair of towers beautiful.
